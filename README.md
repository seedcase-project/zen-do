Interact with the Zenodo API from the command line for common,
high-level tasks. The main aim is to make it easy to create a Zenodo
deposit using metadata from a file kept within a Git repository and
upload one or more files from the repository to that deposit. While the
intended use of zen-do is to integrate with a GitHub Action workflow for
continuous deployment, it can also be used locally from the command line
for more interactive use.
